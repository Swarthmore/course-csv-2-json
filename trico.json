The chemistry of the pigments in paints and the phosphors in LED and fluorescent light fixtures will be covered, along with current challenges and opportunities that advances in the design and chemistry of energy-efficient lighting technology have presented for the way in which we may control the colors of the objects that they light.  We will also discuss the ways in which color scientists quantify color and the challenges that are involved in building a standardized system that is based on not only a physical, but also a physiological and potentially social phenomenon, whose perception may vary widely across and within populations.; Enrollment Limit: 35"," Div: II;  Natural Science (NA)"],"day":["M","W"],"time":["12:45pm-02:15pm"],"deptUrl":"https://www.haverford.edu/chemistry/ "}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"course","_id":"H_Spring_2017_CHEMH225B001","body":{"campus":"Haverford","program":"Chemistry","semester":"Spring 2017","courseNumber":"CHEMH225B001","name":"Organic Reactions and Synthesis","description":["Class Number: 1650","This course will explore organic reactions in mechanistic detail, and highlight their use in the syntheses of complex organic molecules.

With the growing number of Bi-Co students majoring in Linguistics, including Linguistics and Language, and with our Tri-Co linguist on tenure track at Haverford, it is now time to offer a section of the thesis seminar at Haverford. The number for the section is capped at 7 because that is the maximum number of theses each faculty member involved in the seminar will be supervising. Swarthmore will keep multiple sections of the seminar. Given our practice of assigning first and second readers of the thesis after senior majors have decided on the thesis topic in the beginning of the fall semester, we envision this section at Haverford as a course \"shell\" which is open to any senior major in our department, including Swarthmore students, once it is decided that their thesis topic is most closely aligned with Brook Lillehaugen's expertise. My counterpart at Swarthmore, David Harrison, has been directly involved in the discussions about the desirability and feasibility of opening such a section at Haverford, and is strongly in favor of it. If you still have questions about this proposal in the context of our being a Tri-Co department (still the first and only), I will be very happy to answer your questions to your satisfaction.

We will examine spheres of reception for architecture and its theoretical, discursive, and cultural life through a variety of media: buildings of course, but also journals, books, and film. We will also investigate architecture as a site and subject for critical inquiry. In particular, we will see what it may tell us about the globalization and politics of the twentieth century, and about history, theory, and criticism as epistemological tracks.","Approach: Critical Interpretation (CI), Inquiry into the Past (IP);,  ; Haverford: Humanities (HU)","  Enrollment Limit: 40;  Enrollment Criteria:","Major/Minor/Concentration; Sophomore; Junior; Senior; Permission of Instructor;"],"day":["M","W"],"time":["02:40pm-04:00pm"],"deptUrl":"http://www.brynmawr.edu/cities"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"course","_id":"B_Spring_2017_CITYB298001","body":{"campus":"Bryn Mawr","program":"Growth and Structure of Cities","semester":"Spring 2017","courseNumber":"CITYB298001","name":"Topics: Adv Research Methods-Junior Seminar","description":["Class Number: 1047","This is a topics course.

While these ancient scripts  raise such familiar and relevant issues as gender, identity, family-structure, sexuality, loyalty, heroism, and euthanasia, these issues are presented in a way distinct from the literary formats of Modernity: action is compressed within the scope of one day; there are only three actors despite there being many more roles; all the really intense action (e.g., murder, suicide) takes place offstage; and, perhaps most obviously and most importantly, the thematic and aesthetic centerpiece of the play are not the protagonists but the singing and dancing chorus, whose lyrics weave a dense web of mixed metaphors, accumulated appositions, and compound adjectives taking the place of verbs and actions.  Analysis of these lyrics will be key to addressing one of the central questions of the course: how can a genre that is so focused on the incredibly complex choral lyrics be a performance genre?  We will discuss theories of how the plays were performed in fifth-century Greece comparing and contrasting them with modern adaptations of ancient choruses, as in the present-day productions of Theodoros Terzopoulos. Ultimately, the aim of the course is to give students a first-hand experience with the manifold social, emotional, political, and cultural implications of chorality, in both word (poetic script) and deed (performance).","Approach: Writing Intensive;,  ;","  Enrollment Limit: 30;  Enrollment Criteria:","Major/Minor/Concentration; Permission of Instructor;"],"day":["M","W"],"time":["02:40pm-04:00pm"],"deptUrl":"http://www.brynmawr.edu/classics/"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"course","_id":"B_Spring_2017_CSTSB320001","body":{"campus":"Bryn Mawr","program":"Classical Studies","semester":"Spring 2017","courseNumber":"CSTSB320001","name":"Martyrs Mothers Memoirs","description":["Class Number: 2526","The writing of autobiography flourished in the middle ages, but there have been very few studies of the genre for the period.

Elegies are crucial for our understanding of literary history because in addition to coping with individual loss they address larger themes and problems about literature, including what form mourning should take in verse. These poems range from meditating on the vision of someone dying to lamenting the loss of a fellow poet, and they take on excruciating subjects such as the loss of a child or coming to terms with the violent death of a beloved person. An elegy can be both intensely personal and political, forcing us to confront our own mortality and the grief of others. This course examines the rich history of this genre, starting with Elizabethans, including Ben Jonson�s heartbreaking poem �On My First Son,� and ending with Helen Macdonald�s recent memoir, H is for Hawk, that connects her own personal grief with the glo bal ecological crisis. Our readings will address a wide array of social and cultural contexts from the problem of faith in the Victorian period to the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s. We will also consider how the genre of elegy extends beyond poetic form to include narrative and memoir. Major elegies might include Milton�s Lycidas, Thomas Gray�s �Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,� Percy Shelley�s Adonais, Alfred Lord Tennyson�s In Memoriam, Donald Hall�s Without, Joan Didion�s In the Year of Magical Thinking, and Anne Carson�s Nox. We will also engage shorter works by Shakespeare, John Donne, Anne Bradstreet, William Wordsworth, John Keats, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, Christina Rossetti, Thomas Hardy, Anne Sexton, Claude McKay, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Elizabeth Bishop, Theodore Roethke, John Berryman, Mark Doty, Li-Young Lee, Marilyn Hacker, and others. In addition to these primary texts, we will touch on theories of loss and mourning, including the work of Sigmund Freud and Judith Butler","Approach: Critical Interpretation (CI);,  ; Haverford: Humanities (HU)","Enrollment limit; 30"],"day":["M","W"],"time":["11:40am-01:00pm"],"deptUrl":"http://www.brynmawr.edu/english/"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"course","_id":"B_Spring_2017_ENGLB205001","body":{"campus":"Bryn Mawr","program":"English","semester":"Spring 2017","courseNumber":"ENGLB205001","name":"Intro to Film","description":["Class Number: 1422","This course is intended to provide students with the tools of critical film analysis.

The reading in the course will include selections from books of �materialist� theory (such as Jane Bennett�s Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things),  novels (Djuna Barnes, Nightwood, Franz Kafka, Metamorphosis), nonfiction (Annie Dillard, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek), and movies (Ousmane Sembene, Xala, James Cameron, Avatar).","Enrollment Limit: 18;"],"day":["T","Th"],"time":["02:25pm-03:45pm"],"deptUrl":"http://www.brynmawr.edu/english/"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"course","_id":"B_Spring_2017_ENGLB338001","body":{"campus":"Bryn Mawr","program":"English","semester":"Spring 2017","courseNumber":"ENGLB338001","name":"Literature and Visual Culture","description":["Class Number: 2431","This course examines the complex and mutually-informing relationship between literature and images, especially in the nineteenth through twenty-first centuries. We will read broadly in visual culture to elucidate not only written texts, but also photographs, films, paintings, and graphic narratives. We will also consider images that are invisible or that cannot otherwise be seen. Our investigation will begin with questions that are both imaginative and ethical: How does a Victorian poem help us to understand the photographs taken by a contemporary serial killer? What can we see in the literary description of an image that cannot be seen in the image itself? Should we look at the last moments of a human life? The syllabus is divided into a series of foundational thematic units. We will begin the semester thinking about sight and how to look at an image in terms of narrative. To this end, we will read an account written by an art model who describes her experience of posing nude, a narrative that will inform our work with Laura Mulvey's influential essay, \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.\" This theoretical grounding in the gaze and its troubling power will help us to confront Robert Browning's dramatic monologues read with and against photographs taken by criminals. Our next unit will focus on definitions of reality and objectivity in images and narrative accounts of the Holocaust. Readings might include Primo Levi�s The Drowned and the Saved, Art Spiegelman�s Maus, Marianne Hirsch�s The Generation of Postmemory, Susan Sontag�s Regarding the Pain of Others, and Georges Didi-Huberman�s Images in Spite of All. We then consider the problem of representation by drawing on the tradition of poetic ekphrasis to think about visualizing art in literature by John Keats, P. B. Shelley, W. H. Auden, Adam Kirsch, and Natasha Trethewey. Our next unit takes us into the media of reproduction, and we read Walter Benjamin and Roland Barthes along with a novel by W. G. Sebald. Our discussion continues as we address spectacle, surveillance, and consumption in the imagery and literature created in the aftermath of September 11th, including Art Spiegelman's In the Shadow of No Towers, W. J .T. Mitchell's Cloning Terror, Jonathan Crary�s 24/7, and Judith Butler�s Precarious Life. Our final unit takes us back to the foundation of the course--the relationship between art and illusion--that we find in Paul Auster's novel, The Book of Illusions, and E. H. Gombrich","Enrollment limit; 18"],"day":["T"],"time":["07:00pm-10:00pm"],"deptUrl":"http://www.brynmawr.edu/english/"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"course","_id":"B_Spring_2017_ENGLB361001","body":{"campus":"Bryn Mawr","program":"English","semester":"Spring 2017","courseNumber":"ENGLB361001","name":"Literature of Dissent","description":["Class Number: 1210","This course examines literary and historical texts engaged with the social, political, and religious upheavals in late medieval England, including the Black Death, the Hundred Years War, the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, the tyranny and deposition of Richard II, and religious repression.

In this course, we will study the central tenets of South Asian religious traditions and will read and listen to the epic narratives, Sufi poetry and classical Indian music that influenced so much of South Asia�s visual culture. With this foundation, the course will consider the spiritual, social, political and creative motivations that led artists to choose naturalistic or supernatural forms of representation, reaffirming that the anti- and super-naturalistic elements of South Asian art rarely resulted from a lack of skill but from the conscious choice of the artist.  In writing assignments, students will be challenged to find words to describe the myriad representational strategies that South Asian artists have used over time to depict their own world, but also to render other realms. This writing intensive (WI) course will therefore emphasize the importance of using of precise and creative language in art historical visual analysis.","Approach: Cross-Cultural Analysis (CC), Inquiry into the Past (IP), Writing Intensive;,  ;","  Enrollment Limit: 20; Freshmen Spaces: 7;  Enrollment Criteria:","Freshman; Sophomore; Junior; Senior; Major/Minor/Concentration;"],"day":["M","W","F"],"time":["10:10am-11:00am"],"deptUrl":"http://www.brynmawr.edu/hart"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"course","_id":"B_Spring_2017_HARTB108001","body":{"campus":"Bryn Mawr","program":"History of Art","semester":"Spring 2017","courseNumber":"HARTB108001","name":"Women/Feminism/History of Art","description":["Class Number: 1287","An investigation of the history of art since the Renaissance organized around the practice of women artists, the representation of women in art, and the visual economy of the gaze.","Approach: Critical Interpretation (CI), Inquiry into the Past (IP), Writing Intensive;,  ; Haverford: Humanities (HU)","  Enrollment Limit: 20; Freshmen Spaces: 7;  Enrollment Criteria:","Freshman; Sophomore; Junior; Senior; Major/Minor/Concentration;"],"day":["M","W","F"],"time":["11:10am-12:00pm"],"deptUrl":"http://www.brynmawr.edu/hart"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"course","_id":"B_Spring_2017_HARTB108001","body":{"campus":"Bryn Mawr","program":"Gender and Sexuality Studies","semester":"Spring 2017","courseNumber":"HARTB108001","name":"Women/Feminism/History of Art","description":["Class Number: 1287","An investigation of the history of art since the Renaissance organized around the practice of women artists, the representation of women in art, and the visual economy of the gaze.","Approach: Critical Interpretation (CI), Inquiry into the Past (IP), Writing Intensive;,  ; Haverford: Humanities (HU)","  Enrollment Limit: 20; Freshmen Spaces: 7;  Enrollment Criteria:","Freshman; Sophomore; Junior; Senior; Major/Minor/Concentration;"],"day":["M","W","F"],"time":["11:10am-12:00pm"],"deptUrl":"http://www.brynmawr.edu/femgen/"}},{"_index":"courses","_type":"course","_id":"B_Spring_2017_HARTB110001","body":{"campus":"Bryn Mawr","program":"History of Art","semester":"Spring 2017","courseNumber":"HARTB110001","name":"Identification in the Cinema","description":["Class Number: 1152","An introduction to the analysis of film through particular attention to the role of the spectator.

A book is much more than the text or images it contains: books reflect their own histories of creation and use, and books have the capacity to shape their readers� interpretations of their contents.

This course begins in the year 1797 at the end of the Republic and the emerging of an extensive body of literature centered on Venice and its mythical facets. Readings will include the Romantic views of Venice (excerpts from Lord Byron, Fredrick Schiller, Wolfang von Goethe, Ugo Foscolo, Alessandro Manzoni) and the 20th century reshaping of the literary myth (readings from Thomas Mann, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Gabriele D�Annunzio, Henry James, and others). A journey into this fascinating tradition will shed light on how the literary and visual representation of Venice, rather than focusing on a nostalgic evocation of the death of the Republic, became a territory of exploration for literary modernity.

As a manifestation of the nationalism sweeping over Europe during the nineteenth century, the Risorgimento aimed to unite Italy under one flag and one government. For many Italians, however, Risorgimento meant more than political unity. It described a movement for the renewal of Italian society and people beyond purely political aims. Among Italian patriots the common denominator was a desire for freedom from foreign control, liberalism, and constitutionalism. The course will discuss issues such as Enlightenment, Romanticism, Nationalism, and the complex relationship between history and literature in Foscolo, Manzoni, and Leopardi.

Many such novels were written in the Victorian period. Long before developmental psychopathology was a scientific discipline, its main questions were insightfully probed by 19th and early 20th century novelists in books such as \"The Secret Garden.\" In this course, each book will be analyzed for the literary devices used to portray healthy adjustment and maladjustment, the implicit theories of psychological causation captured in the narratives, and the ways the novelist depicts life experiences that bring about mental health and personal growth. Each book will be discussed in its historical/literary contexts, and compared with current views drawn from psychological research.

From the time of Genghis Khan and the Mongolian yoke�s invasion of Kievan Rus� in the 13th century to the present day and Vladimir Putin�s ongoing geopolitical pivot to the east, Russia has grappled with its eastern roots, its vast eastern expanse, and Sino-Russian relations.  This course will explore a wide variety of cultural manifestations of Russia�s eastern orientation: Russian philosophy at the turn into the 20th century that emphasized Russia�s eastern, mystical focus; Russian symbolist poetry and prose that amplified Russia�s ties to the East; silent cinema of the 1920s that linked revolution to the East; non-fiction accounts of penal colonies and work camps scattered throughout Siberia (with particular emphasis on the work of Chekhov, Solzhenitsyn, Shalamov); late Soviet fiction probing life in rural Siberia; and contemporary Russian fiction that revisits Russia�s eastern mysticism.
