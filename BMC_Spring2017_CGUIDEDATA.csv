With the guidance of a mentor and through reading and research, the student will learn to perform the many organizational and communications tasks involved in stage management. Students will be required to read a number of texts with the goal of understanding the vast scope of the job, the artistry and authority expected of a stage manager, the variations in styles of stage management, and the standard procedures a student stage manager can incorporate into a college setting. Each student will be expected to keep a daily journal of their experience�intellectual, artistic, and practical. The journal is their own and is meant to stimulate and deepen their thinking about the process. This practicum requires that a student be willing to engage in the production process both as an artist with an intellectual stake in the work and as an adult with a position of real authority in the group. The student will be expected to use that authority while always remaining calm, polite, kind, and generous to the artists with whom they are working.

It also uses these conjugates to study the modes by which architecture may be said to have framed history. We will study practical and discursive activity that formed a dynamic field within which many of the contradictions of �the modern� were made visible (and visual) through architecture. In this course, we will engage architectural concepts and designs by studying drawings and buildings closely within their historical context. We will examine spheres of reception for architecture and its theoretical, discursive, and cultural life through a variety of media: buildings of course, but also journals, books, and film. We will also investigate architecture as a site and subject for critical inquiry.

While these ancient scripts  raise such familiar and relevant issues as gender, identity, family-structure, sexuality, loyalty, heroism, and euthanasia, these issues are presented in a way distinct from the literary formats of Modernity: action is compressed within the scope of one day; there are only three actors despite there being many more roles; all the really intense action (e.g., murder, suicide) takes place offstage; and, perhaps most obviously and most importantly, the thematic and aesthetic centerpiece of the play are not the protagonists but the singing and dancing chorus, whose lyrics weave a dense web of mixed metaphors, accumulated appositions, and compound adjectives taking the place of verbs and actions.  Analysis of these lyrics will be key to addressing one of the central questions of the course: how can a genre that is so focused on the incredibly complex choral lyrics be a performance genre?  We will discuss theories of how the plays were performed in fifth-century Greece comparing and contrasting them with modern adaptations of ancient choruses, as in the present-day productions of Theodoros Terzopoulos. Ultimately, the aim of the course is to give students a first-hand experience with the manifold social, emotional, political, and cultural implications of chorality, in both word (poetic script) and deed (performance).|Approach: Writing Intensive;,  ;|  Enrollment Limit: 30;  Enrollment Criteria:|Major/Minor/Concentration; Permission of Instructor;	http://www.brynmawr.edu/classics/	Departmental Homepage	https://www.brynmawr.edu/registrar/undergraduates/classes-exams/bookstore-textbooks-list	Book Prices

Elegies are crucial for our understanding of literary history because in addition to coping with individual loss they address larger themes and problems about literature, including what form mourning should take in verse. These poems range from meditating on the vision of someone dying to lamenting the loss of a fellow poet, and they take on excruciating subjects such as the loss of a child or coming to terms with the violent death of a beloved person. An elegy can be both intensely personal and political, forcing us to confront our own mortality and the grief of others. This course examines the rich history of this genre, starting with Elizabethans, including Ben Jonson�s heartbreaking poem �On My First Son,� and ending with Helen Macdonald�s recent memoir, H is for Hawk, that connects her own personal grief with the glo bal ecological crisis. Our readings will address a wide array of social and cultural contexts from the problem of faith in the Victorian period to the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s. We will also consider how the genre of elegy extends beyond poetic form to include narrative and memoir. Major elegies might include Milton�s Lycidas, Thomas Gray�s �Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,� Percy Shelley�s Adonais, Alfred Lord Tennyson�s In Memoriam, Donald Hall�s Without, Joan Didion�s In the Year of Magical Thinking, and Anne Carson�s Nox. We will also engage shorter works by Shakespeare, John Donne, Anne Bradstreet, William Wordsworth, John Keats, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, Christina Rossetti, Thomas Hardy, Anne Sexton, Claude McKay, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Elizabeth Bishop, Theodore Roethke, John Berryman, Mark Doty, Li-Young Lee, Marilyn Hacker, and others. In addition to these primary texts, we will touch on theories of loss and mourning, including the work of Sigmund Freud and Judith Butler|Approach: Critical Interpretation (CI);,  ; Haverford: Humanities (HU)|Enrollment limit; 30	http://www.brynmawr.edu/english/	Departmental Homepage	https://www.brynmawr.edu/registrar/undergraduates/classes-exams/bookstore-textbooks-list	Book Prices

Generally what supposedly makes humans valuable is the mind, so we will look at works that treat the mind as just another body part.  We will also read some critical theory that explains how valuing the mind over the body, the human over the animal, has been used to support racism, sexism, and colonialism--and has led to the destruction of the ecological system.  The course will include both works that present the social, political, and biological horrors resulting from the separation of the non-human from the human, and works that imagine humans merging with nature.  The reading in the course will include selections from books of �materialist� theory (such as Jane Bennett�s Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things),  novels (Djuna Barnes, Nightwood, Franz Kafka, Metamorphosis), nonfiction (Annie Dillard, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek), and movies (Ousmane Sembene, Xala, James Cameron, Avatar).|Enrollment Limit: 18;	http://www.brynmawr.edu/english/	Departmental Homepage	https://www.brynmawr.edu/registrar/undergraduates/classes-exams/bookstore-textbooks-list	Book Prices

We will read broadly in visual culture to elucidate not only written texts, but also photographs, films, paintings, and graphic narratives. We will also consider images that are invisible or that cannot otherwise be seen. Our investigation will begin with questions that are both imaginative and ethical: How does a Victorian poem help us to understand the photographs taken by a contemporary serial killer? What can we see in the literary description of an image that cannot be seen in the image itself? Should we look at the last moments of a human life? The syllabus is divided into a series of foundational thematic units. We will begin the semester thinking about sight and how to look at an image in terms of narrative. To this end, we will read an account written by an art model who describes her experience of posing nude, a narrative that will inform our work with Laura Mulvey's influential essay, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema." This theoretical grounding in the gaze and its troubling power will help us to confront Robert Browning's dramatic monologues read with and against photographs taken by criminals. Our next unit will focus on definitions of reality and objectivity in images and narrative accounts of the Holocaust. Readings might include Primo Levi�s The Drowned and the Saved, Art Spiegelman�s Maus, Marianne Hirsch�s The Generation of Postmemory, Susan Sontag�s Regarding the Pain of Others, and Georges Didi-Huberman�s Images in Spite of All. We then consider the problem of representation by drawing on the tradition of poetic ekphrasis to think about visualizing art in literature by John Keats, P. B. Shelley, W. H. Auden, Adam Kirsch, and Natasha Trethewey. Our next unit takes us into the media of reproduction, and we read Walter Benjamin and Roland Barthes along with a novel by W. G. Sebald. Our discussion continues as we address spectacle, surveillance, and consumption in the imagery and literature created in the aftermath of September 11th, including Art Spiegelman's In the Shadow of No Towers, W. J .T. Mitchell's Cloning Terror, Jonathan Crary�s 24/7, and Judith Butler�s Precarious Life. Our final unit takes us back to the foundation of the course--the relationship between art and illusion--that we find in Paul Auster's novel, The Book of Illusions, and E. H.

Class Nbr: 1084 CC;IP;WI;	Class Number: 1084|This course examines the coexistence of aniconic, figural and supernatural representations of gods, plants, humans and animals in the Hindu, Buddhist, Jain and Islamic artistic traditions of India.  It will trace both the development of naturalistic representations, as well as departures and embellishments on naturalism in the painting, sculpture, architecture, metalwork and textiles of South Asia. In this course, we will study the central tenets of South Asian religious traditions and will read and listen to the epic narratives, Sufi poetry and classical Indian music that influenced so much of South Asia�s visual culture. With this foundation, the course will consider the spiritual, social, political and creative motivations that led artists to choose naturalistic or supernatural forms of representation, reaffirming that the anti- and super-naturalistic elements of South Asian art rarely resulted from a lack of skill but from the conscious choice of the artist.  In writing assignments, students will be challenged to find words to describe the myriad representational strategies that South Asian artists have used over time to depict their own world, but also to render other realms. This writing intensive (WI) course will therefore emphasize the importance of using of precise and creative language in art historical visual analysis.|Approach: Cross-Cultural Analysis (CC), Inquiry into the Past (IP), Writing Intensive;,  ;|  Enrollment Limit: 20; Freshmen Spaces: 7;  Enrollment Criteria:|Freshman; Sophomore; Junior; Senior; Major/Minor/Concentration;	http://www.brynmawr.edu/hart	Departmental Homepage	https://www.brynmawr.edu/registrar/undergraduates/classes-exams/bookstore-textbooks-list	Book Prices

As a manifestation of the nationalism sweeping over Europe during the nineteenth century, the Risorgimento aimed to unite Italy under one flag and one government. For many Italians, however, Risorgimento meant more than political unity. It described a movement for the renewal of Italian society and people beyond purely political aims. Among Italian patriots the common denominator was a desire for freedom from foreign control, liberalism, and constitutionalism. The course will discuss issues such as Enlightenment, Romanticism, Nationalism, and the complex relationship between history and literature in Foscolo, Manzoni, and Leopardi.

The wisdom of the ancient world has importantly shaped the tradition of Western thought but in some important respects it has been rejected or forgotten.  What is the nature of reality?  Can we have knowledge about the world and ourselves, and, if so, how?  In this course we explore answers to these sorts of metaphysical, epistemological, ethical, and political questions by examining the works of the two central Greek philosophers:  Plato and Aristotle.  We will consider earlier Greek religious and dramatic writings, a few Presocratic philosophers, and the person of Socrates who never wrote a word.|Approach: Critical Interpretation (CI), Inquiry into the Past (IP), Writing Intensive;,  ; Haverford: Humanities (HU)|  Enrollment Limit: 30;  Enrollment Criteria: Permission of Instructor;	http://www.brynmawr.edu/philosophy	Departmental Homepage	https://www.brynmawr.edu/registrar/undergraduates/classes-exams/bookstore-textbooks-list	Book Prices

Can we obtain knowledge of the world and, if so, how? Does God exist? What is the nature of the self? How do we determine morally right answers? What sorts of policies and political structures can best promote justice and equality? These questions were addressed in �modern� Europe in the context of the development of modern science and the religious wars. In a time of globalization we are all, more or less, heirs of the Enlightenment which sees its legacy to be modern science and the mastery of nature together with democracy and human rights. This course explores the above questions and considers them in their historical context.

In everyday life our arguments tend to be informal and sometimes imprecise. The study of logic concerns the structure and nature of arguments, and so helps to analyze them more precisely. Topics will include: valid and invalid arguments, determining the logical structure of ordinary sentences, reasoning with truth-functional connectives, and inferences involving quantifiers and predicates.

These questions may include the history of philosophical approaches in science, the nature of scientific knowledge, changes in scientific knowledge over time, how science provides explanations of what we observe, the justification of false assumptions in science, the nature of scientific theories, and some questions about the ethics and values involved in scientific practice.|Approach: Critical Interpretation (CI);,  ; Haverford: Humanities (HU)	http://www.brynmawr.edu/philosophy	Departmental Homepage	https://www.brynmawr.edu/registrar/undergraduates/classes-exams/bookstore-textbooks-list	Book Prices

This seminar introduces the intellectual history of comparative political economy and development studies with readings on both comparative political economy and international political economy. First, we will examine the debates on the dynamics of the state and the market in the development and globalization process. Second, we will explore specific case studies to discuss: 1) how the political and economic processes have changed in response to the interaction of the domestic and international arenas, 2) whether and how the late developers learned from the experiences of early developers, 3) how the international economy and international financial crisis shaped domestic development strategies. Lastly, we will analyze the developmental concerns at the sub-national level with financial liberalization.

This seminar, taught by a former CIA counterterrorism officer, will give students a sociological perspective on terrorism, including the ways in which the threat of terrorism has changed over time, the motivations of different terrorist groups, and the circumstances under which terrorism succeeds and fails. We will also explore America�s counterterrorism efforts and grapple with some of the most challenging questions facing the U.S. intelligence community today: what are the best ways to combat terrorism?

Then, theories and research on the causes and consequences of child maltreatment are studied.  The legal and political structure of child welfare services in the U.S. is considered, along with the extent to which this system provides a continuum of care, copes with residual problems of other service sectors (e.g., welfare, mental health, substance abuse, and housing), and prevents or perpetuates oppression of women, children, people of color, and other disadvantaged groups.  The course focuses on micro-, meso-, and macro-level practice issues and research findings in the areas of child protection, in-home services, out-of-home care, adoption, treatment, and prevention of child maltreatment.  Issues of cultural sensitivity and new directions for practice are considered in each of these areas.
