Genetic changes that produce variations between organisms are an important aspect of evolutionary change. Since development can be viewed as the process that links genetic information to the final form of an organism, the fields of development and evolution clearly impact one another. We will look at Drosophila and zebrafish, where developmental mechanisms have been elucidated in remarkable detail. We will then look beyond these model systems to comparative studies that examine development in a range of organisms, considering how these provide insight into evolutionary mechanisms, and how underlying differences in development may account for the differences we see between organisms.; Prerequisite: Biology 200 or consent of instructor.

Using the fruit fly as a model system, we are looking inside cells to ask how intricate changes to the cytoarchitecture of individual cells drive movements of entire layers of cells. We hope to further understand how these same developmental processes go awry in situations of human disease (e.g. cancer metastasis).

Have you ever wondered what makes the sky appear blue, an apple appear red, and the sun appear a yellowish white at midday?  In this course, we will discuss the underlying physical processes that are involved in the production of light and the ways in which its interaction with matter leads to the colors we see in the objects that make up the world around us.  The chemistry of the pigments in paints and the phosphors in LED and fluorescent light fixtures will be covered, along with current challenges and opportunities that advances in the design and chemistry of energy-efficient lighting technology have presented for the way in which we may control the colors of the objects that they light.  We will also discuss the ways in which color scientists quantify color and the challenges that are involved in building a standardized system that is based on not only a physical, but also a physiological and potentially social phenomenon, whose perception may vary widely across and within populations.; Enrollment Limit: 35| Div: II;  Natural Science (NA)	https://www.haverford.edu/chemistry/ 	Link to Departmental Homepage	http://www.haverfordbookstore.com/selecttermdept.aspx	Book Prices

The successful separation from extra-aesthetic determinants opened up new representational possibilities, in which the “beautiful” became boring and the "ugly" became interesting. Focusing on major literary figures from Goethe to Jelinek, the seminar will examine the 'paradigm shift' towards a modern aesthetics of transgression in which social, racial, and sexual deviancy take center stage.; Cross-listed: German, Comparative Literature Humanities (HU)	https://www.haverford.edu/german 	Link to Departmental Homepage	http://www.haverfordbookstore.com/selecttermdept.aspx	Book Prices

H	Spring 2017	LINGH399B001	Linguistics	LING	399B	001	Senior Thesis Seminar	1.00	 		 	 			 	Huang,Shizhe	Class Nbr: 2023 Lim: 15 HU	Class Number: 2023|This seminar exposes students to linguistic research methods and guides them through the conceptualization of a topic, the research, and the writing of a senior thesis. All linguistics majors must write their senior thesis in this seminar or Ling S100 or S195. Enrollment limited to 15 students, Senior linguistics majors only.; ; ****; Long Description:; ; The Senior Thesis Seminar has been offered only at Swarthmore for all Tri-Co seniors in our department up to this point. With the growing number of Bi-Co students majoring in Linguistics, including Linguistics and Language, and with our Tri-Co linguist on tenure track at Haverford, it is now time to offer a section of the thesis seminar at Haverford. The number for the section is capped at 7 because that is the maximum number of theses each faculty member involved in the seminar will be supervising. Swarthmore will keep multiple sections of the seminar. Given our practice of assigning first and second readers of the thesis after senior majors have decided on the thesis topic in the beginning of the fall semester, we envision this section at Haverford as a course "shell" which is open to any senior major in our department, including Swarthmore students, once it is decided that their thesis topic is most closely aligned with Brook Lillehaugen's expertise. My counterpart at Swarthmore, David Harrison, has been directly involved in the discussions about the desirability and feasibility of opening such a section at Haverford, and is strongly in favor of it. If you still have questions about this proposal in the context of our being a Tri-Co department (still the first and only), I will be very happy to answer your questions to your satisfaction.

This course is appropriate for students who sing or play an instrument, but who have had little or no systematic instruction in music theory.  Topics include time and pitch and their notation, scales, intervals, triads, basic harmonic progressions, melodic construction, harmonization of melody, non-harmonic tones, transposition, and key change (modulation).  Students who wish to explore the art of musical composition will find this course especially useful, as two creative projects are assigned:  the composition of a pair of melodies in the major and minor modes, and a 32-bar piece which changes key.  Preparation for these projects is provided through listening and analysis of works in a variety of musical styles.  Students having completed this course will be prepared to enter Music 203, the first semester of the theory sequence for music majors.

But on what basis are we to make such distinctions? What grounds, if anything, our definitions of good and bad? How can we be certain that our actions, and thus our own selves, are not evil? This course examines such concerns through a survey of the history of ethical philosophy. In digging up the “root of all good,” we will consider as well questions of self-interest, justice, freedom, and duty. Readings include selections from Plato’s Republic, Mill’s Utilitarianism, Kant’s Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, and Nietzsche’s Beyond Good and Evil.
